## About The Project

Today the Corona Pandemic has affected all in a way or so and the entire mankind has been forced into introspection, reflection, and analysis of what Nature wishes to communicate.
During Corona Pandemic, everything is happening virtually but yet there are certain people who are forced to do from door to door of a blood bank in search of the blood for their patient and sometimes the person is unable to get the required blood group in time and lose their dear ones.

Here we present before you our #HackForGood solution for the society serving the need for the present time.

The aim is to provide emergency blood bank service to the person who mentions “@BloodFinderBot” on their twitter handle requesting the blood group and specifying their city.
